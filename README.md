# Heyo. I'm Frowzy.

#### Welcome to my page.

I'm a student who's likely working on various miscellaneous projects at the same time, jumping between them as I see fit for what I wish to do that particular day.

I primarily enjoy writing for the web, usually doing both the front and back-ends on my projects dedicated to documentation and information gathering and various experimental WordPress & MediaWiki endeavours. 

I'm currently working on a static website for which I hope to replace this README. It'll be located [here](https://frowzy.github.io/) and will contain far more information.

In the time being, here's a TL;DR:

## The deets

My public repos are hosted on my [GitHub](https://github.com/Frowzy). All my work is free for you to use, but not redistribute as your own. 

I maintain a thin internet presence. If you wish to reach me, you may do so via E-mail once I set up a public mailbox or on the messaging platform Discord at `Frowzy#5733`.


## Misc info

I am a fan of TV shows. In recent times I've enjoyed the detective drama *"True Detective"* on HBO and the medical drama *"House"* on Fox.

I've been a tech enthusiast for quite some time now and I most particularly enjoy tinkering with tech that may be deemed obsolete or vintage by today's standards and giving them a new lease on life. My most recent project was an iPod Video I had the pleasure of restoring and replacing the 30GB hard drive with a 128GB SD card. 

Anyhow, thanks for coming. 

Take care.

:P)
