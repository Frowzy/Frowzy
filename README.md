# Heyo. I'm Frowzy.

## Welcome to my page!

I'm currently working on a static website for which I hope to replace this README. It'll be located [here](https://frowzy.github.io/) and will contain far more information once I get to it. I'm often preoccupied with my education and work, so it will take some time before I get to it.

In the time being, here's a TL;DR:

## The deets

My public repos are hosted on my [GitHub](https://github.com/Frowzy). All my work is free for you to use for any personal or commercial purouse.

I maintain a thin internet presence. If you wish to reach me, you may do so via E-mail once I set up a public mailbox or on the messaging platform Discord at `Frowzy#5733`.


Anyhow, thanks for coming. 

Take care.

:P)
